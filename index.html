    <h3>SK Soil Map &middot; <a href="http://sksoil.usask.ca:8080/sksoil/">sksoil.usask.ca</a></h3>
    <p>I worked on this project with a small team at the U of S. The goal was to develop a modern framework to store and allow public access to digital soil data. The project is still in the development phase, but we hope to have a protoype available by the end of August 2016.</p>

    <p>I did the UI design and the front-end development on this project.</p>
    
    <p>This link will be down periodically while building the application. Please contact me if you're particularily interested, and I can provide you with more information about the project.</p>

    <h3>Canadian System of Soil Classification App &middot; <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=1132685496&mt=8">link</a></h3>
    <p>I made this app as a replacement for the classification key in the Canadian System of Soil Classification Manual. It accomplishies the exact same thing, just a bit faster and without having to flip through a book. </p>
